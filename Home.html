<p style="width:500px; margin:auto;font-family:comic sans ms"> Hey! My name is Stephanie and my girlfriends name is Isabell. We originally met in 2011 through her sister but later started talking seriously. We talked for two years until we finally let go of our boyfriends to be together. We wrote letters to eachother and I was kinda nervous to ask her out. I finally got the courage to go up to her October 4, 2013. Now we are still happily together, laughing at the way have came to be. </p> </div>
